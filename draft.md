<!-- --------------------------- Vector Roadmap ---------------------------- -->

Understand the requirements and design of the 'std::vector' container. Study its current implementation and its use cases.

Research and study different techniques for dynamic memory management, such as allocating and deallocating memory, and managing memory fragmentation.

Design the new implementation of the 'std::vector' container, taking into account the requirements and design constraints.

Implement the new 'std::vector' container, including all necessary member functions and supporting functions.

Test the new implementation thoroughly, using a variety of test cases and edge cases.

Optimize the implementation for performance, if necessary.

Document the new implementation and its usage.

Compare the new implementation with the existing implementation of 'std::vector' in terms of performance, memory usage, and other relevant factors.
